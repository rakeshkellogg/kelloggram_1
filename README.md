Our final project is deployed via netlify at https://homiesdesign.netlify.app/index.html

KIEI-451 Winter 2021 FinalProject Summary: Our project is a crowdsourcing platform for interior design. A user submits a design request of the room they'd like to be redesigned via an image url. Other users on the app contribute design ideas and the user can crowdsource likes to see which project is most popular. 

 Team: Lilianna Myers, Rakesh Mohanty, Alex Glover

A note on the evolution of our final: This project went through a lot of iterations (as we have learned that most development projects do!). With this in mind, we adapted our project in a few ways - we started with the intent of having multiple HTML pages, but ultimately streamlined to 1 so that we could focus on the JavaScript and backend functionality. We also had envisioned a more sophisticated system in which there was more information submitted than an image url, yet this too was cut in the name of a true MVP. One thing that we loved about reducing our scope was that it allowed us to simplify down to the best part of our idea, which we saw as the way to crowdsource feedback on a design proposal. We would love to keep iterating!
