Our final project is deployed via netlify at https://homiesdesign.netlify.app/index.html

KIEI-451 Winter 2021 FinalProject Summary: Our project is a crowdsourcing platform for interior design. A user submits a design request of the room they'd like to be redesigned via an image url. Other users on the app contribute design ideas and the user can crowdsource likes to see which project is most popular. 
It's basically like a separate kelloggram for each of the design request submitted by an user.

 Team: Lilianna Myers, Rakesh Mohanty, Alex Glover

A note on the evolution of our final: This project went through several iterations (as we have learned that most development projects do!). We adapted our project in a few ways - we started with the intent of building many distinct pieces of html to guide a user through an in-depth profile creation process before they begin sharing content and interacting with other users, but ultimately we refocused our efforts on the content sharing and interacting pieces, in the spirit of an MVP to prove our app's utility. We've proven this functionality - 1. that users can share ugly rooms that need a face-lift, 2. that any user can view all design ideas submitted for a specific ugly room, AND 3. that any user can give ONE thumbs up/down to each design idea to help the ugly room owner sift through all the great design suggestions. In this way, we create a community focused around interior design, where an individual can wear multiple hats: seeking advice, giving advice, and liking/disliking others' advice. In a future iteration, we'd enable users to share additional details about themselves and their ugly rooms or design ideas, such as preferred style, budget, etc. We'd love to keep iterating!
